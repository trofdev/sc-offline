# Contributing to sc-offline

Thanks for helping. sc-offline is a Star Citizen offline mod: a single-player mod menu plus a launcher that keeps the game offline while you play. Bug reports, fixes, docs and testing on your PC all help.

## What fits this project

- **Offline, single-player only.** Nothing that connects to Star Citizen's servers, changes online play, or helps anyone cheat, bypass anti-cheat while online, or hurt other players. PRs like that are closed.
- **No game files.** Don't commit Star Citizen files, extracted game data, or anything copied from Cloud Imperium Games. Ship class names and other identifiers in `data/` are fine.
- **No secrets or personal data.** Strip account names, Windows user paths and tokens from logs before you post them.
- **Undo what you change.** Anything the launcher changes on the PC (hosts file, firewall rules, renamed files) must be listed and undone afterwards; see [PC changes](docs/launcher.md#pc-changes).

## Reporting a bug

Use the [Bug report](https://github.com/trofdev/sc-offline/issues/new/choose) form. Include the output of `sc-offline.exe status` and attach `data/launcher.log`, `data/mod.log` and the game's `Game.log`. One problem per issue. Check [Troubleshooting](README.md#troubleshooting) first.

For security problems (the administrator helper, a change the launcher doesn't undo), **don't open a public issue**; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Making a change

1. For anything bigger than a small fix, open an issue first so we can agree on the approach.
2. Fork the repo and branch from `main`.
3. Build and check as described in [docs/build.md](docs/build.md):
   - Windows: build **Release | x64** with Visual Studio.
   - macOS or Linux: `tools/check.sh` must report `0 new` diagnostics. It isn't a build; CI's MSVC build is the real check.
4. Test in game if you can, and say in the PR what you tested and what you didn't.
5. Update the docs your change affects (`README.md`, `docs/`, `sc-offline.ini` comments) in the same PR.
6. Add a line under the top section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for anything a player would notice.
7. Open the PR against `main` and fill in the template. CI (`check` and `build`) must pass.

PRs are squash-merged. Keep one change per PR.

## Code style

- Match the surrounding code: C++ in `src/` (the mod) and `launcher/` (the launcher), no new dependencies without discussing it first.
- In `src/`, don't put `__try` in a function that owns objects with destructors (such as `std::string`); MSVC rejects it (C2712) and `tools/check.sh` screens for it.
- Write messages players will read in plain words: what happened and what to do.
